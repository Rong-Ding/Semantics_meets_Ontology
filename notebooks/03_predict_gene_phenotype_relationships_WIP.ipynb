The cosine similarities did not consistently differ across the biologically positive, neutral, and negative gene-trait pairs. Notably, even pairs with hypothetical negative biological correlations yielded positive similarity scores, sometimes exceeding those of positively correlated pairs.\n","\n","However, as this was just a toy demo involving three curated examples, it is for now also hard to conclude that distributional semantic models could contribute little to functional prediction between genes and traits. The validity of the examples used, as well as the scalability of the experiment, awaits more expertised advice (notably, it was difficult to find gene terms with suitable plant traits that met the design of the experiment).\n","\n","These results nonetheless highlight an important consideration: **context may heavily influence embedding representations**, such that both positively and negatively correlated (or even merely semantically associated) gene-trait pairs frequently co-occur in similar textual environments. As a result, they may appear equally \"similar\" in vector space, despite their opposing biological roles—making them difficult to disentangle using distributional semantics alone.\n","\n","This indeed raises a broader question: if language models rely primarily on contextual co-occurrence, can they meaningfully contribute to functional discovery in biology, where relationships often require **directionality**,  **mechanistic interpretation**, or even **causality**? A reasonable next step could be to incorporate structured information, such as **knowledge graphs**, which encode logical and causal relationships between entities. Training vector representations based on these structured sources may offer a more biologically faithful foundation for modeling gene-trait associations."],"metadata":{"id":"2ytpqn7Ski3L"}}]}
